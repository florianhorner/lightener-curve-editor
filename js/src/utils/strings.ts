/**
 * Centralized user-facing copy for the Lightener card.
 *
 * Why this file exists: it is the single lintable home for the card's display
 * text, so "Lead with the light" (see the Voice and vocabulary section of
 * DESIGN.md) can be enforced mechanically. `scripts/lint-vocabulary` scans this
 * file against the project banned-term list, so cold or generic wording cannot
 * quietly re-enter the UI. Card copy is migrated here over time (scrubber,
 * footer, presets, legend, and the graph y-axis so far); add new or changed
 * card text here and import it rather than hardcoding it in a component. Copy
 * still inline elsewhere is not yet guarded — see DESIGN.md "Where copy lives".
 *
 * Scope note: config-flow copy lives in the Home Assistant translation files
 * (`custom_components/lightener_studio/translations/*.json`) and is out of this file's
 * scope by design — that text is keyed and localized through HA.
