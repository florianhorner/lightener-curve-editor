# Lightener Curve Editor — CLAUDE.md

## What this is

A Home Assistant custom integration (HACS) that controls groups of lights with
per-light brightness curves. Fork of fredck/lightener with an interactive
curve-editor card.

## Quality gates

### Release ZIP structure (critical)

HACS `zip_release: true` extracts the zip **directly** into
`/config/custom_components/lightener/`. If the zip contains a
`custom_components/lightener/` prefix, files land at
`…/lightener/custom_components/lightener/` and HA silently fails with
"Integration not found" — no import error, no traceback, just gone.

**Rule:** The release zip MUST have `manifest.json` at the root. No
`custom_components/` prefix anywhere in the archive.

**Enforcement:** The `release.yml` workflow validates this automatically and
fails the release if the structure is wrong.

**Manual uploads:** Never manually upload a zip to a GitHub release. Always let
the release workflow build it via the `cd … && zip -r ./` pattern. If you must
rebuild manually, run from inside `custom_components/lightener/`:

```bash
cd custom_components/lightener
zip lightener.zip -r ./
# Verify:
unzip -l lightener.zip | grep -c "custom_components/"  # must be 0
```

### Shipping procedure

1. Bump version in `manifest.json` (the release workflow also patches it from the tag, but keep them in sync)
2. Create a GitHub release with tag `vX.Y.Z`
3. Let the Release workflow run — it builds the zip, validates structure, uploads
4. **Do not** manually re-upload or replace the release zip asset
5. After HACS picks up the new version, test on HA: verify the integration loads (`manifest/get` via websocket must succeed)

## Development

- `scripts/setup` — create venv and install deps
- `scripts/develop` — run HA locally with the integration
- `scripts/lint` — run linters
- Integration source lives in `custom_components/lightener/`
- Frontend card JS lives in `custom_components/lightener/frontend/`
- Card source (if editing) lives in `js/`
