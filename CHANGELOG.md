## [Unreleased]

## [2.8.1] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- Restored Lightener setup for migrated configurations
- Fixed brightness mapping migration handling to avoid double-wrapping
- Fixed the `configuration.yaml` setup path when using migrated config data

### Added

- Interactive brightness curve editor card (`custom:lightener-curve-card`)
  - Visual editing of per-light brightness curves directly in the HA dashboard
  - Smooth bezier curves with gradient fills
  - Colorblind-accessible dash patterns to distinguish curves
  - Brightness scrubber with real-time bar gauge readouts per light
  - Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+S to save, Esc to cancel
  - Unsaved-changes guard (browser prompt before navigating away)
  - Light and dark theme support via Home Assistant CSS custom properties
  - Mobile-responsive layout with touch-optimised controls
- WebSocket API (`lightener/get_curves`, `lightener/save_curves`) for reading and writing brightness configs from the frontend
  - Read access available to all authenticated users (for dashboard display)
  - Write access restricted to Home Assistant administrators

### Changed

- Renamed HACS display name to "Lightener Curve Editor" to avoid confusion with upstream

### Fixed

- Home Assistant 2026.x compatibility (`async_register_static_paths` API)
- Overlapping curves: selected curve now renders on top so all control points stay clickable
- Curve load race condition when Home Assistant sends rapid state updates
- Legend name truncation for long entity names
- Dirty-state indicator not clearing after save
- Small hit targets making control points hard to grab
- Timer leak when card is removed from the DOM

### Also includes

- Recent UI polish, theming, mobile, and release-readiness improvements validated in the release candidate

## [2.4.0] - Upstream
