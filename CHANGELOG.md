# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [2.15.0-dev.1] - 2026-04-19

### Changed

- Curve endpoint control point is now removable: `Space`, `Delete`, and right-click work on the last point the same as on interior points. The minimum 2-point guard still applies.
- When a curve has no explicit 100 control point, the UI saves an explicit `(100, last_target)` entry so the curve flattens at the last configured level on reload (e.g. a curve ending at `[50%, 40%]` outputs 40% for all inputs ≥ 50%). Backend defaults for legacy YAML configs that omit the 100 key are unchanged.
- ARIA labels on graph points now use two categories — origin (Y-only, no remove) and all other points (free move + remove) — replacing the prior three-way distinction.

### Fixed

- Preview restore correctly handles on/off-only lights (no brightness attribute): they are restored with `turn_on` without a brightness argument, rather than having a brightness level forced onto them.
- Save-success timer is cleared before re-arming on rapid successive saves, preventing a status flap when saves complete inside the 2-second display window.

## [2.14.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Preview toggle** — new "Preview" button in the card header lets you push the live brightness to all lights in the group while you shape the curve, without holding the scrubber. Lights restore automatically when preview is stopped, the card is navigated away from, or the entity changes
- **Origin point Y-drag** — the leftmost control point (brightness at 0% input) can now be dragged vertically to set a dim floor, with a dashed stroke and `ns-resize` cursor to indicate constrained movement
- **Badge overflow** — when the light-selector bar is too narrow to show all badges, excess ones collapse behind a "+N more" button with `aria-expanded` toggle

### Changed

- Save-lifecycle state machine extracted into a pure TypeScript reducer (`save-lifecycle.ts`) — three ad-hoc `@state` booleans collapsed into one `SaveState` + selectors, making save logic testable in isolation
- Brightness helpers extracted from `light.py` into a dedicated `brightness.py` module — identical behaviour, cleaner module boundaries
- Coverage gates hardened: Python floor raised to 90% (baseline 94.74%), JS thresholds set at 75/65/75/75 (baseline 82.52/73.76/83.47/80.52)

### Fixed

- Preview stops on `disconnectedCallback` — lights no longer stuck at preview brightness after navigating away
- Preview scrubber indicator now defaults to 50% when preview starts before the scrubber has been touched, so the graph stays in sync with what lights receive
- Preview throttle now fires a trailing-edge send so the final scrubber position always reaches lights, even after rapid movement
- Rapid preview toggle after an entity switch no longer sends stale brightness restore targets
- Origin control point is now protected from accidental long-press deletion on mobile
- Badge overflow measurement skipped while expanded, fixing an infinite expand/collapse flicker loop
- ARIA labels on keyboard-editable control points now correctly distinguish origin (Y-only) and all other points (free move + remove) — previously all said "Space removes"
- Focus-visible styles added to Preview, Presets, and preset-option buttons for keyboard accessibility
- Division by zero in `scaleRangedValue` when source range is degenerate — now returns target range start instead of `NaN`
- Floating promise anti-pattern in `curve-graph.ts`: `.updateComplete.then()` calls now guarded with `.catch(() => {})` to prevent unhandled rejections on disconnect
- Undo stack for old entity cleared on entity-switch bail path, preventing stale undo history from a previous entity being replayable after switch-back
- Config flow: `_area_filter` internal key regression test added

## [2.13.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Curve presets** — new "Presets" button in the card header opens a one-click picker with four named curves: Linear, Dim accent, Late starter, and Night mode. Each shows a miniature curve preview. Applies to the selected light only, or all lights if nothing is selected. Fully undoable with Ctrl+Z.

### Fixed

- Presets panel closes automatically when you drag a point, cancel edits, or switch entities — no orphaned panel after navigating away
- Clicking a preset while a save is already in flight is now ignored — previously the UI could fall out of sync with what was actually saved
- Clicking a preset before curves have loaded no longer creates a phantom undo entry
- Config flow: removed unsupported `description` field from curve preset select options, fixing a crash in pytest on HA 2024.11+

## [2.12.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- Config flow: area filter step between name and light picker — select a room first to narrow 100+ lights down to the relevant subset on mobile
- Config flow: mode descriptions on all four curve presets (Linear, Dim accent, Late starter, Night mode) shown as radio cards with plain-language explanations
- Brightness preview: "Previewing live — release to restore original brightness" notice shown in the status area while the scrubber is held
- Keyboard-accessible graph point editing: focus curve points, move them with arrow keys, add with `Enter`, remove with `Space`
- `DESIGN.md` documenting UI tokens, component patterns, and accessibility expectations for the editor

### Changed

- Scrubber preview throttle increased from ~16ms (60fps RAF) to 300ms minimum interval, capping at ~3 commands/sec per light to prevent Zigbee/Matter/MQTT command backlog buildup
- Graph hint text updated: "Select a light below — each gets its own curve" to clarify that curves are per-light
- Editor panel empty state now explains what Lightener is, how to create a group, and links straight to Home Assistant Integrations
- Embedded narrow-screen layout now keeps save and cancel actions in a sticky footer directly below the graph stack
- Curve loading now uses a graph-shaped skeleton instead of pulsing text

### Fixed

- SVG adds `user-select: none; -webkit-user-select: none` to prevent iOS from selecting text or triggering native gestures during long-press on control points
- Entity switching in the sidebar panel no longer drops dirty curve edits silently; it now requires inline save or discard confirmation
- Scrubber badge overflow now shows a `+N more` indicator instead of silently clipping extra values

## [2.11.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- Embedded workspace layout: 2-column grid (graph+scrubber | legend+footer) when the curve card is hosted in the editor panel, single-column stack on narrow screens
- "Lights" section label on the legend component for scannable hierarchy
- Dynamic SVG `<desc>` element for screen reader curve summary (e.g. "3 curves: Ceiling Light, Sofa Lamp, LED Strip")
- Design review TODOs (TODOS.md) with 10 tracked improvement items

### Changed

- Editor panel shell: wider max-width (1360px), styled control-row with gradient surface, responsive breakpoints at 900px
- Panel DOM construction is now one-time: `shadowRoot.innerHTML` only runs on first render, preventing card-mount wipe on hass updates
- Panel uses ES module import (`import()`) instead of script tag injection for curve card loading
- Entity picker filters by `config_entry_id` when deep-linked via `?config_entry=...` URL param
- Error retry buttons changed from "Tap to retry" to "Retry"
- CSS custom properties (`--curve-graph-max-height`, `--curve-legend-max-height`, `--curve-scrubber-badges-max-height`) for component sizing in embedded mode

### Fixed

- Card mount cleared when no entity is selected (previously showed stale card)
- Panel entity loading race condition with config_entry filtering

## [2.10.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- Structured observability layer (`observability.py`): every `turn_on`, `turn_off`, and WebSocket call now emits trace spans, counters, histograms, and structured log events that can be consumed by any log aggregator

### Changed

- `async_update_group_state` now uses an O(1) dict lookup (`_entities_by_id`) instead of a nested O(n) scan, with early exit once the common-level intersection empties — faster state convergence when controlling many lights
- Brightness map construction is now cached via `lru_cache`: lights sharing an identical curve config reuse precomputed maps instead of rebuilding them at startup
- Test dependency bumps: pytest 8→9, pytest-asyncio, pytest-homeassistant-custom-component (includes pycares constraint update)
- JS dev dependency bumps: `@rollup/plugin-terser` 0.4→1.0 (fixes high-severity CVEs in serialize-javascript), vitest 4.1.2→4.1.4 (fixes path-traversal and WebSocket file-read CVEs in vite)

### Fixed

- `async_update_group_state` early-exit no longer skips `is_lightener_change` context detection for unprocessed entities; brightness display after a Lightener-initiated change now correctly uses the preferred level even when levels intersection empties before all entities are visited

### Added

- Visual card configuration editor (`lightener-curve-card-editor`) with HA-native entity picker and optional custom title
- Live light preview: scrubbing the brightness slider pushes interpolated brightness to physical lights in real-time via `light.turn_on`/`turn_off`; brightness restores on release
- Card header now renders from `config.title` with "Brightness Curves" as default
- `DEFAULT_BRIGHTNESS` constant in `const.py` for consistent default curves across config flow and light platform
- Built-in config-flow curve presets (`linear`, `dim_accent`, `late_starter`, `night_mode`) for onboarding without manual curve authoring
- Dedicated Home Assistant sidebar panel (`/lightener-editor`) that hosts the curve editor without requiring manual dashboard card setup
- New `lightener/list_entities` websocket API for panel entity discovery
- Undo support for curve edits (footer undo button and Ctrl/Cmd+Z shortcut)
- Shared graph math module (`graph-math.ts`) with geometry/interpolation helpers reused by graph and scrubber
- 44 new Vitest unit tests (`card-logic.test.ts` and `graph-math.test.ts`) covering undo flow, interaction guards, and curve math
- Release workflow zip validation step that fails when a nested `custom_components/` path is present or `manifest.json` is missing at zip root

### Changed

- Config flow simplified: name your device, pick lights, done — no more text-based brightness mapping
- Options flow simplified: add or remove lights in one step; existing brightness curves are preserved
- Config and options flows now include a starter curve preset selector; selected preset is applied to newly added lights only
- Both flows now guide users to the Lightener Curve Editor card for visual curve editing
- Flow descriptions now point to both the sidebar panel and dashboard card for visual editing
- Config and options flow now show curve preset label ("Starting curve preset") in both setup and edit flows
- Scrubber now emits position events and stays in sync with the graph, including a vertical guide and per-curve value dots
- Curve legend shape markers now use shared constants from graph math utilities for consistent rendering
- Graph and scrubber now sample values through the same smooth-curve interpolation path for consistent badge and graph readouts

### Removed

- Text-based per-light brightness mapping step (replaced by visual curve editor card)

### Fixed

- Graph SVG reference now uses Lit `@query` decorator so drag and double-click work correctly if the graph panel unmounts and remounts during a loading cycle
- Removed a duplicated interpolation code path so graph and scrubber value sampling no longer drift from each other
- Mobile editing behavior now supports long-press point removal while preserving drag interactions
- Undo/cancel animations now preserve each curve's live visibility state instead of restoring stale visibility from snapshots
- Global keyboard shortcuts are now scoped to the card focus context, avoiding accidental save/undo/cancel when focus is outside the card
- WebSocket curve saves now reject unknown entities and malformed per-entity brightness payload shapes
- Release workflow now injects tag version via shell env expansion so manifest version updates resolve reliably
- Integration setup now tolerates sidebar panel registration failures without blocking startup
- Badge text contrast: yellow and orange curve badges now use darkened text to pass WCAG AA
- SVG axis labels and hints scale to 12px on mobile (was 9-10px)
- Control point hit circles use dynamic radius via `matchMedia` for reliable 44px+ touch targets on all mobile WebViews
- Hint text now reads "Dbl-click to add, Right-click or long-press to remove" (was touch-only phrasing)
- Success message fades in and out smoothly instead of disappearing abruptly
- `beforeunload` dialog now works in Firefox (added `returnValue`)
- Legend eye toggle now includes `aria-pressed` for screen reader toggle state
- Sidebar panel entity picker now uses DOM API instead of innerHTML, preventing XSS via crafted entity names
- GitHub Actions `hassfest` and `hacs/action` pinned to commit SHAs instead of mutable branch refs
- Sidebar panel curve editor no longer goes blank after entity list loads: the shadow DOM structure is now built once and updated in-place, so the card mount point is never wiped by subsequent `hass` updates
- `lightener/list_entities` WebSocket response now includes `config_entry_id` so the panel can filter entities by config entry when opened from the integration config flow
- 16 new Vitest unit tests for the sidebar panel (`lightener-panel.test.ts`) covering entity selection, card lifecycle, and config-entry filtering

## [2.9.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- "Layered Panels" card redesign: graph, scrubber, and legend each sit in their own tinted sub-panel with subtle depth
- Colorblind-safe curve palette: replaced green colors with indigo and brown
- Shape markers in legend (circle, square, diamond, triangle, bar) for color-independent identification
- Loading indicator with pulse animation while curves are being fetched
- "Editing: {name}" label in graph header showing which curve is selected
- Retry buttons on load and save errors with `role="alert"` for screen readers
- Keyboard support: arrow keys on scrubber slider, Enter/Space on legend items, Ctrl+S to save, Esc to cancel
- Live demo via GitHub Pages
- Scenario switcher in dev mode for testing 2-light, 3-light, 20-light, and long entity ID edge cases
- 32 unit tests covering data conversion and interpolation

### Changed

- Scrubber redesigned: gradient track, round thumb, inline value badges replace bar charts
- Legend selection uses accent underline instead of left border
- Card border radius 12px to 16px, refined layered shadow, padding 16px to 20px
- Save button uses consistent #2563EB blue across all themes
- Footer buttons rounded to 8px

### Fixed

- Right-click to remove control points now works (pointerdown was intercepting right-click button)
- Success status uses blue (#2563EB) with checkmark icon instead of green (colorblind-safe)
- Error/success regions use `role="status"`/`role="alert"` and `aria-live` for screen readers
- Retry affordances converted from spans to focusable buttons
- Value badges cap at 2 rows with overflow hidden (prevents layout explosion with 20+ lights)
- Badge names truncate at 80px with ellipsis for long entity IDs
- WebSocket handler validates curve payload types before accessing `.get()` (prevents crash on malformed messages)
- Legend items are keyboard-operable (tabindex, Enter/Space, ArrowUp/ArrowDown)
- Hint text moved inside graph area to avoid axis label overlap

## [2.8.1] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- Restored Lightener setup for migrated configurations
- Fixed brightness mapping migration handling to avoid double-wrapping
- Fixed the `configuration.yaml` setup path when using migrated config data

### Added

- Interactive brightness curve editor card (`custom:lightener-curve-card`)
  - Visual editing of per-light brightness curves directly in the HA dashboard
  - Smooth bezier curves with gradient fills
  - Colorblind-accessible dash patterns to distinguish curves
  - Brightness scrubber with real-time bar gauge readouts per light
  - Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+S to save, Esc to cancel
  - Unsaved-changes guard (browser prompt before navigating away)
  - Light and dark theme support via Home Assistant CSS custom properties
  - Mobile-responsive layout with touch-optimised controls
- WebSocket API (`lightener/get_curves`, `lightener/save_curves`) for reading and writing brightness configs from the frontend
  - Read access available to all authenticated users (for dashboard display)
  - Write access restricted to Home Assistant administrators

### Changed

- Renamed HACS display name to "Lightener Curve Editor" to avoid confusion with upstream

### Fixed

- Home Assistant 2026.x compatibility (`async_register_static_paths` API)
- Overlapping curves: selected curve now renders on top so all control points stay clickable
- Curve load race condition when Home Assistant sends rapid state updates
- Legend name truncation for long entity names
- Dirty-state indicator not clearing after save
- Small hit targets making control points hard to grab
- Timer leak when card is removed from the DOM

### Also includes

- Recent UI polish, theming, mobile, and release-readiness improvements validated in the release candidate
