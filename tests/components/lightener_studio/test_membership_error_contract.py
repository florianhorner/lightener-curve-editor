"""Contract test pinning the backend membership error codes to the shared fixture.

The membership transaction reports failures as error codes over the websocket;
the editor dialog turns those codes into user-facing copy. The two sides are
written in different languages, so nothing but a shared fixture keeps them
aligned. This is the same arrangement ``curve_presets.json`` already provides
for the shape definitions.

This test pins the *backend* set of codes. ``js/src/components/
light-membership-dialog.errors.test.ts`` pins the frontend's handling of the
same fixture. A new backend code that the editor has never heard of now fails
here instead of reaching a user as an unhelpful fallback message.

Scope, so the guarantee is not read wider than it is: this covers codes raised
as ``MembershipError`` in ``membership.py``. ``websocket.py`` also answers with
codes it passes straight to ``connection.send_error`` — ``unauthorized`` and
``invalid_format`` come from the ``@require_admin`` decorator and the command
schema, and are Home Assistant's own envelope rather than a domain rule. Those
are pinned by ``test_send_error_codes_outside_the_contract_are_known`` below so
a *new* one cannot appear unnoticed.
